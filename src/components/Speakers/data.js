    abstract: 'Gabriella Adèr is a freelance journalist and also works on producing and researching for documentaries and podcasts. Currently, she works for the NRC in the editorial team for podcasts. She collaborated in documentaries such as ‘De Villamoord’, a documentary about the villa murder in 1998 and what mistakes were made trying to solve this crime. Others are ‘Misdaaddokters’ (‘Crime Doctors’), ‘Cocainekoorts’ (‘Cocaine Fever’) and ‘Leven met de Maffia’ (‘Live with the Mafia’). In her work Gabriella is searching for stories representing our society and she is especially interested in the paradoxes that are present in these. This makes crime and justice a particular interest of hers. This interest and her enthusiasm makes her a fantastic host for our symposium.',

    title: `The attribution of attackers in cyberspace`,
    abstract: `Cyberspace is more and more the playfield of nation states. They try to steal information or disrupt computer systems. The big question here is, how can we be sure what country was responsible for an attack. Do false flag attacks also exist and how hard are they to uncover? And if forensic analysts are able to trace an attack back to a country, how can we be sure that the leaders of the country are actually responsible? Ronald Prins, head of Fox-IT from 1999-2017 and internet security expert will explain how they can identify the hackers that are responsible for these attacks.`,
