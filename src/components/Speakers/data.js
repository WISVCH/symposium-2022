    abstract: 'Gabriella Adèr is a journalist and also works on producing and researching for documentaries and podcasts. Currently, she works for the NRC in the editorial team for podcasts as well as hosting the daily podcast ‘Vandaag’. She collaborated in documentaries such as ‘De Villamoord’, a documentary about the villa murder in 1998 and what mistakes were made trying to solve this crime. Other projects are ‘Misdaaddokters’ (‘Crime Doctors’), ‘Cocainekoorts’ (‘Cocaine Fever’) and ‘Leven met de Maffia’ (‘Live with the Mafia’). She is also still working on releasing more exciting documentaries. In her work Gabriella is searching for stories representing our society and she is especially interested in the paradoxes that are present in these. This makes crime and justice a particular interest of hers. This interest and her enthusiasm makes her a fantastic host for our symposium.',

    title: `The attribution of attackers in cyberspace`,
    abstract: `Cyberspace is more and more the playfield of nation states. They try to steal information or disrupt computer systems. The big question here is, how can we be sure what country was responsible for an attack. Do false flag attacks also exist and how hard are they to uncover? And if forensic analysts are able to trace an attack back to a country, how can we be sure that the leaders of the country are actually responsible? Ronald Prins, head of Fox-IT from 1999-2017 and internet security expert will explain how they can identify the hackers that are responsible for these attacks.`,

His presentation will be about the interpretation of DNA mixtures, traces to which several people have contributed, found at crime scenes. He will explain the mathematical models used to calculate the likelihood of a certain person being present at the scene of the crime. Furthermore, he will talk about the communication between the forensic department and the judicial system.`,

    title: `Detection of Financial crime`,
    abstract: `Financial crime has increasingly become of concern over the past years to governments throughout the world. In the Netherlands alone, an estimated 16 billion euros is laundered annually, tied to predicate offences ranging from human trafficking, and narcotics trafficking to terrorist financing. Financial institutions are committed to detecting these money flows, as part of their 'gatekeeper' role to protect the integrity of the financial system. This fight against money laundering involves a huge amount of data crunching and the application of more advanced analytics in detection. Stefanie Vonk, manager in forensic and financial crime analytics, helps financial institutions in the detection of money laundering and by this plays a role in fighting criminals. She will explain what a complete case study looks like and gives some examples of how to use advanced analytics to keep the financial infrastructure safe.`,

    title: `Evidence based on digital data`,
    abstract: `Crimes leave trails and these trails can also be digital. Think about the texts sent from phones or data from smartwatches. Many conclusions can be made from this information also using likelihood ratios.  For example from heart beat rate, language and voice, financial research and undermining. Zeno Geradts is a professor by special appointment of forensic data science at the UvA and works with the AI4Forensics lab. There they do research on the statements that can be made based on data from phones and smartwatches and also on deep fakes. In his talk he will introduce you to their research and give real life examples.`,
